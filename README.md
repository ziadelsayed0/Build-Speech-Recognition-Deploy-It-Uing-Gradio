# **Speech Recognition - Deploy It Using Gradio**  

This project implements a **speech recognition system** using **OpenAI's Whisper model** and a dataset from **Hugging Face**. The model is deployed using **Gradio**, providing an interactive web-based interface for real-time speech-to-text conversion.  

---

## **Introduction**
This project leverages **Whisper**, a state-of-the-art speech recognition model, to transcribe audio into text. The model is fine-tuned using a dataset from **Hugging Face** and is deployed with **Gradio**, allowing users to easily test and interact with the system.

## **Features**
✅ Uses **Whisper model** for high-accuracy speech recognition  
✅ Pretrained dataset from **Hugging Face**  
✅ **Real-time transcription** with Gradio web interface  
✅ Supports multiple audio formats (WAV, MP3, etc.)  
✅ Easy deployment and integration
